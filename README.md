## 🧠 Introduction

Our project presents an advanced educational tool that leverages eye-tracking and audio analysis to detect and support students with dyslexia and other learning disabilities. It builds a complete ecosystem connecting students, teachers, and support professionals to ensure early identification and intervention.

---

## ❗ Problem Statement

Dyslexia affects 15–20% of the population, with many cases going undetected. Traditional diagnostic methods miss up to 50% of dyslexic students, delaying help and negatively impacting their academic growth and self-esteem. Our solution addresses the need for accurate, early diagnosis and tailored educational support.

## ✅ Solution Overview

We propose a unified platform that:

- Tracks eye movements in real-time during reading.
- Analyzes audio to assess speech clarity and pace.
- Integrates visual and auditory data for deeper diagnosis.
- Generates personalized reports with detailed insights.
- Maintains secure student profiles to monitor progress.
- Recommends custom learning interventions.
- Offers a teacher dashboard for oversight and progress tracking.

**What makes us unique:**

- Combines eye-tracking and audio data (85% accuracy vs. 60% traditional).
- Personalized reports and adaptive strategies.
- Complete support ecosystem from diagnosis to intervention.
